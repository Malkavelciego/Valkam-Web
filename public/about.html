<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Miguel Ojeda, but my friends, call me Malkav.<br/>From a very young age I started playing with my father’s Sinclair ZX Spectrum.</p>
<p>After that my first computer arrived. Graphic adventures, management, platforms, action… Everything that fell into my hands.</p>
<p>I started “mastering” RPG games for my classmates at breaks with six-sided dice and campaigns based on Dragon Lore: The Legend Begins.<br/>
  Then came Dungeons and Dragons, World of Darkness and many others (to this day).<br/>
  For all this I always wanted to work creating games.<br/>
  Even before I knew what a Game Designer is and with everyone around me thinking I was crazy,<br/>
  I started going into video games creation, where I found my next step: studying a Master in Game Designer at U-tad.<br/>
  Now what I want most is starting a career in the video games industry.</p>
